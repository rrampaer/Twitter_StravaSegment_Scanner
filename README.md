# Twitter_StravaSegment_Scanner
A twitter bot that scans for change in Strava's segments' leaderboards. 
## How is it hosted?
It runs from https://www.pythonanywhere.com - python script + the MySQL DB. It does a great job, allows for decent CPU & the possibility to have scheduled task is valuable in this case.
## Add segments
You can add segments for scanning by tweeting "@StravaBrussels add [segmentid]"
